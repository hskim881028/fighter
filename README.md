# fighter
 Side project. It is now a barren field. Soon it will be turned into a game. This project was created by using two patterns appropriately.   
 
 
 The first is the command pattern. It was created with reference to WPF of .NET Framework. All actions are stored in a buffer and executed according to the rules(there are no rules yet).
 
Secondly, I used mvp pattern to separate view and logic. The mvp pattern was implemented using unirx. 

Resources are managed using ScriptableObject. 

Using Unity's new input system, keyboards, virtual pads, and controllers are easily supported.

## System Requirements
- Unity 2020.3.11f1

## Packages
- Input System (To Support virtual pad, keyboard and controller)

## Plugins

- DOTween
